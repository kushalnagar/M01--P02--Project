Datastore with Consistent Hashing


1. Make sure that you have Python 3.6, or higher, installed. At your command prompt, run:

$ python --version
Python 3.7.3
If not installed, install the latest available version of Python 3.

2.To run the code in the source code folder, run the following command:

$ python3 data_store.py (On many Linux/Mac platforms)
OR
$ python data_store.py (On Windows/Mac platforms)

In any case, one of these two commands should work.

3. Alternatively, you could install a popular Python IDE, such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code, and select a command to build the project from there.
